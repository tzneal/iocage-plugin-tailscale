Tailscale has been installed! (but not configured)
<br/>
To configure tailscale, click Jails and then launch
a shell into the tailscale jail.  Then configure
tailscale normally.  As an example, to advertise 
routes to your local network, run (using your local 
network's CIDR): 
<br/>
<pre>
tailscale up --advertise-routes=192.168.1.0/24
</pre>
<br/>
Advertising routes is probably the best use case
When running as a plugin. Because of the jail,
tailscale will only expose the jail and not the
rest of TrueNAS.
